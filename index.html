    <h1>CODE CHALLENGES:</h1>
    <h2>1. Speed Detector</h2>
    <p>
        Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".
    </p>
    <h3>Should achieve: </h3>
    <p>Determine if a driver's speed is within legal limits and issue demerit points accordingly.</p>
    <h2>2. Student Grade Generator</h2>
    
    <p>
        Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: A (> 79), B (60 to 79), C (59 to 49), D (40 to 49), E (less than 40).
    </p>
    <h3>Should achieve: </h3>
    <p>Calculate and display the grade based on the input student marks.</p>
    <h2>3. Net Salary Calculator</h2>
    <p>
        Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
    </p>
    <h3>Should achieve: </h3>
    <p>Calculate an individual's net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits, including tax, NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions.</p>
