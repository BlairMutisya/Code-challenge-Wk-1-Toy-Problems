# Code Challenges
This repository contains solutions for three code challenges. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of Python programming, from basic conditionals to more complex calculations.

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
### Description

The Student Grade Generator program prompts the user to input student marks. It then evaluates these marks and assigns a corresponding grade based on predefined criteria:

* A: Marks greater than 79
* B: Marks between 60 and 79
* C: Marks between 50 and 59
* D: Marks between 40 and 49
* E: Marks less than 40

### Solution Overview
The solution for this challenge involves taking user input, evaluating the marks against the criteria, and outputting the corresponding grade.

### Solution Implementation
The solution utilizes conditional statements to determine the grade based on the input marks.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector
### Description

The Speed Detector program takes as input the speed of a car and calculates demerit points based on exceeding the speed limit. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program notifies that the license is suspended.

### Solution Overview
The solution involves taking the car's speed as input, calculating demerit points based on the speed limit, and handling scenarios where demerit points exceed the threshold for license suspension.

### Solution Implementation
The solution utilizes mathematical calculations and conditional statements to determine demerit points and whether the license should be suspended.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
### Description

The Net Salary Calculator program calculates an individualâ€™s net salary based on inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.

### Solution Overview
The solution involves computing various deductions and taxes from the gross salary to arrive at the net salary. It utilizes predefined tax rates and deduction percentages.

### Solution Implementation
The solution implements functions to calculate payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and finally computes the net salary.
